Slush is a world-renowned startup focused conference. Like Money20/20, it is not a cryptocurrency or blockchain conference, but it’s an event designed to help and propel early startups by connecting them to strategic partners, advisors, and experts in various industries. In other words, the entire purpose of this conference is to guide new projects to the right path and provide them access to key resources so that they can thrive.

**This year, Particl is going to be participating in the Helsinki’s edition, in Finland, by having a booth and also by taking part in the Slush100 pitching competition** ([more information on Slush’s website](https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/#/concepts=&dayFilters=&industries=&sideEventId=&targetAudience=)).

What’s very interesting about Slush is the altruistic “help each other out” mindset behind the event, its partners, and its attendees. To maximize its presence at the event, Particl will be able to pre-schedule meetings with various businesses, advisors, investors, and more. This will tie in nicely with the progress and new connections that Particl will have made during the Particl World Tour, especially those made at Money20/20.
