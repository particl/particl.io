       At Particl, we’re building a brand new decentralized and democratic economy supported by the Particl blockchain; a very secure and privacy-focused network where applications of all sorts can be built and operated without any middleman. Particl aims at offering the same range of services currently available on the web but with security, privacy, and most importantly, near-zero fees in mind.
