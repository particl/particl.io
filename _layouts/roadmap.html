            <p>How do you protect against sybil attacks and gaming of reputation in a privacy focused marketplace?</p>
            <p>This is a big question that requires some serious R&D. Everything is 10&times; harder when applying privacy to it. Reputation is important in ecommerce. The development and research teams will spend a lot of time flushing out the importance and risks of reputation in a privacy focused marketplace.</p>
