            <p>Development SDK allows to further decentralize the development process of the Particl ecosystem and gives businesses the necessary tools to easily integrate some of the components of the Particl network through APIs and developer tools. This is a critical part of making Particl a truly open financial system and will make it easier for projects to leverage some of Particl’s components.</p>

This roadmap item allows sellers to automate the relisting of listings so that they don’t have to manually log in every time they expire.

They are designed to enable efficient Confidential Transactions (CT), and thus RingCT, effectively reducing their transaction size by about ~80%.
