Among these changes, users can expect to see the Marketplace Governance mechanism as well as the RingCT enhancement made to our current MAD escrow system. On top of that, other less critical features might be included as well, including private listings and markets, deposit negotiations, multiwallets, settings page, and more.</p>

            <p>How do you protect against sybil attacks and gaming of reputation in a privacy focused marketplace?</p>
            <p>This is a big question that requires some serious R&D. Everything is 10&times; harder when applying privacy to it. Reputation is important in ecommerce. The development and research teams will spend a lot of time flushing out the importance and risks of reputation in a privacy focused marketplace.</p>

            <p>All versions of the MP leading up to full release will be testnet versions with new features introduced with each release. Particl Marketplace’s mainnet requirements are as follow: a working decentralized Marketplace Governance mechanism in place and a RingCT-enhanced escrow system, both on mainnet. The first mainnet iteration of Particl Marketplace may also contain other features such currency-agnosticism (accepting multiple coins through atomic swaps or third-party integrations), multiwallets, private listings and markets, deposit negotiations, and etc.</p>

            <p>Bulletproofs are short non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs that require no trusted setup. They are designed to enable efficient Confidential Transactions (CT), and thus RingCT, effectively reducing their transaction size by about ~80%. We estimate the research, development, implementation, and testing to take around 3 to 4 months as a part-time assignment for Tecnovert, our Lead Core Developer & Cryptographer.</p>
